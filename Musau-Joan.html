        <!-- about me section/background -->
           <p>Joan is a student of the world. She however is a computer sceintist by profession having studied the same in university. Taking a class at <a href="www.moringaschool.com" target="blank">Moringa school</a> was a decision arrived at from the dire need to perfect her coding skills.</p>
            <p>Musau loves a number of things. Her free time which is almost 'non-existant' is packed with activities. Just to name a few,
             <ol>
              <li>
                <!-- hobbies/skills/interests-->
                <h4><em>code</em></h4>
                  <img src="image/code.jpg">
                  <p>Coding is an activity spent hours on. Though this is less of leisure but more of a skill being learnt, it is something she fully enjoys and finds herself doing frequently.</p>
              </li>
                <br>
              <li>
                <h4><em>Music</em></h4>
                  <img src="image/music B.jpg">
                  <p>Music speaks to all souls,even those that don't exist and Joan is no exception.</p>
              </li>
                <br>
              <li>
                <h4><em>Travel</em></h4>
                  <img src="image/travel.jpg">
                  <img src="image/travel B.jpg">
                  <p>Seeing the world outside the norm is always an enlightning activity.It not only relaxes the body but also the mind.It gives peace where it had been lost and restores hope for all. Travelling and exploration.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4><em>soccer</em></h4>
                  <img src="image/football.jpg">
                  <p>Games are a nice way to unwind and for Joan, it's also a nice place to show her very competitive side.</p>
                  <p>Of all games, soccer feels the most grounded.Not only is it fun to play but also gives such thrill to spectate.</p>
                  <p> When watched with family and friends, it's a nice way to bond and determine the trajectory of those relationships if you happen to support different teams but even so,it's a game she loves.</p>
